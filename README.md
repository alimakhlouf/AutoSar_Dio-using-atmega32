# AutoSar_Dio-using-atmega32

This is a Dio driver that I made which is based on Autosar standard. I used Port_Init function from Port module for initializing the Dio channels , it's a stub function(not based on autosar standard). I also used Det_Init & Det_ReportError and they are also stub functions. hope you review my code & give me feedback.
